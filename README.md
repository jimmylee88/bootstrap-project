## About
This is my submission for the bootstrap project this week.
I wanted to create something from scratch, and again it's for a real person who does actually want a new website design.
So I will probably carry on updating it, and adding content to it after submission to the course, so I can show it as a potential client piece.

## Approach
Honestly I found it all a bit confusing and daunting at first, but eventually got round to the idea of wrapping things in bootstrap containers.
I'm still trying to get my head around the Bootstrap grid system and utility classes. So would love to carry on exploring this.
It was so handy having out of the box responsive components that I could use like the nav and carousel, but did find it finicky trying to customise parts of them exactly how I wanted at times. There are still so many components that I didn't quite have time to utilise. 

Responsiveness was really important to me, and having elements that worked well across all screen sizes was something that I tested out quite a lot.
You can see with how many media queries I added just to make sure headings and images in the hero section scaled how I wanted them to. Not entirely sure I've done it in a smart way, surely there's an easier method?

So, I started out a bit frustrated but eventually was won over by how much easier certain things were made by Bootstrap. Namely the responsiveness once I figured out how.
